What's the difference between Git and GitHub? 
Git is a system of working that keeps track of each version created or modified of/to a project. This is known as a version control system. It is literally controlling each version made my 1 or more users to a project. 
Github is a platform that lets user hold reprositories of code/projects. They can be shared, pushed and pulled by different users. Users can also see changes made, and why/when. If code has been modified with git on just a local database, i.e terminal it can be hard for changes to be seen in real time.
Can you think of an analogy to describe them?
Git is like keeping a log of changes made when creating a recipe. Github is sharing the changes so others can replicate and review, as well as contribute to the recipe. Someone could be focussed on the icing of a cake and keeping track of the changes in their recipe book, and then sharing the changes on Github. Another could be focussed on the base of the cake. 
If they are both working on the cake at the same time without guidelines or boundaries, they need to communicate.
Do you think you would still remember the difference a week from now if you didn't revisit the material?
No
Did you stick to the timebox suggestions? If not, why not?
No. I found it so hard to get my head around the differences, but also explain what they are.
